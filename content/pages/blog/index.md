      I got my Bachelor of Science in Art's and Entertainment Technology in
      2021. During my final year while working as a teaching asssitant, I
      discovered that managing the architecture of Canvas courses with visuals
      wpould improve student learning. Instead of pursuing 3D modeing and a
      cereer, i went on to earn my Masters of Education in Learning
      Teachnologies. There, I found that Educational Design and Prfofessional
      design had many overlaps that I coupd use to bridge my way into to world
      of UX Desgin. While Consumer Mertrics may be my \[passion, you will be
      pleased to know that I excel at Figma mockups, Information Architecture
      generation, Presentations, and future planning.




      I love to spend my time with my daughter and husband, walking in the
      parks, cooking new Asian dishes, growing herbs, and supporting a home for
      dishevels animals. I used to run the Texas Flag and UT football games, and
      helped generate 4 days full of blood donations to We Are Blood.
