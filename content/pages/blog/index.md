      I got my Bachelor of Science in Art's and Entertainment Technology in
      2021. During my final year while working as a teaching assistant, I
      discovered that managing the architecture of Canvas courses with visuals
      would improve student learning. Instead of pursuing 3D modeling as my
      career, I went on to earn my Masters of Education in Learning
      Technologies. There, I found that Educational Design and Professional
      Design had many overlaps that I could use to bridge my way into to world
      of UX Design. While Consumer Metrics may be my passion, you will be
      pleased to know that I excel at Figma mockups, Information Architecture
      generation, Presentations, and future planning. 


      As you will find in my work, I love to lead with empathy and passion. I
      adore spending my time with my daughter and husband, walking through state
      parks, cooking new Asian and Mediterranean dishes, growing herbs, and
      supporting a home for disheveled animals. 


      I used to run the Texas Flag during the UT football games, and helped
      generate 4 days full of blood donations to We Are Blood.
